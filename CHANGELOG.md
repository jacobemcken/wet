# Changelog

This software uses [BreakVer](https://www.taoensso.com/break-versioning) (~~not SemVer~~),
which is a bit more pragmatic.
TLDR; Always check the `CHANGELOG`
when either the major or minor version number changes,
otherwise you are probably safe to update.


## 0.3.1 (2025-03-22)

* Add support for `java.time.Instant` for `date` filters


## 0.3.0 (2025-03-13)

* Add support for 'EmptyDrop' objects when asserting
* Add support for "comment" tag
* Add support for "render" tag with params


## 0.2.1 (2025-01-02)

Only released to have a common reference point (code)
with `com.flocktory/wet 0.2.1` (Aug 2018).
